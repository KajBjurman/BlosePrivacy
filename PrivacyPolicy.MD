# Blose: Privacy policy

Blose is a Wear OS 3 Watchface developed by Kaj Bjurman. 

The application does not collect any user data, and isn't sharing user data. All data (e.g alarm levels, glucose readings) is erased when you uninstall the app.

# Account deletion

Blose doesn't create or manage any accounts, so there's nothing to delete.

Yours sincerely,
Kaj
