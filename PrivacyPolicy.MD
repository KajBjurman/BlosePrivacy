# Blose: Privacy policy

Blose is a Wear OS 3/4 Watchface developed by Kaj Bjurman. 

The application is storing credentials encrypted on the device. The credentials, and all data (e.g alarm levels, glucose readings) is erased when you uninstall the app.
The credentials are needed in order to fetch glucose values.

# Account deletion

Blose doesn't create or manage any accounts, so there's nothing to delete.

Yours sincerely,
Kaj
